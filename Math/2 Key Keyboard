Input: n = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: Initially, we have one character 'A'.
In step 1, we use Copy All operation.
In step 2, we use Paste operation to get 'AA'.
In step 3, we use Paste operation to get 'AAA'.

class Solution {
public:
    int minSteps(int n) {

        if(n == 1)
            return 0;

        int steps = 0;
        int factor = 2;

        while(n > 1)
        {
            while (n % factor == 0) {
                steps += factor;
                n /= factor;
            }
            factor++;
        }
        
        return steps;
        
    }
};
