Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.


class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& arr) {
          int maxPro = 0;
    int n = arr.size();
    int minPrice = INT_MAX;

    for (int i = 0; i < arr.size(); i++) {
        minPrice = min(minPrice, arr[i]);
        maxPro = max(maxPro, arr[i] - minPrice);
    }
    
    return maxPro;
    }
};
