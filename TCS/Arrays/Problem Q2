Q1. Given a non-negative integer array Arr having size N. Each element of the array will carry a different
value. This means no two elements can have the same values.The candidate has to do this with minimal
changes in the original value of the elements, making every element as least as much value as it originally
had.
Find the minimum sum of all elements that can be set the array for:
Example 1:
Input
3 -> Value of N, represents size of Arr
2 -> Value of Arr[0]
2-> Value of Arr[1]
4-> Value of Arr[2]
Output
9
Explanation:
As two elements have the same value, max value for the one of them needs to be incremented to 3.
He can set the array with 2+3+4=9
Example 2:
Input
2 -> Value of N, represents size of Arr
3 -> Value of Arr[0]
4-> Value of Arr[1]
5-> Value of Arr[2]
Output
Wrong Input
Explanation:
Here N=2, so we need to provide value of only two elements but we are providing value of three elements
so result is “Wrong Input”
The Input format for the testing
First input line: Accept a single positive integer value for N representing the size of Arr[]
Second input line: Accept N number of integer values separated by a new line, representing the original
value assigned to each element.
Output Format for testing:
The output must be a non integer only (See the output format example).
